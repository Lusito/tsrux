# Setup

This library is shipped as es2015 modules. To use them in browsers, you'll have to transpile them using webpack or similar, which you probably already do.

## Install with NPM:
```
npm i tsrux
```

## Install with Yarn:
```
yarn add tsrux
```

## Redux

You will need [redux](https://redux.js.org) to use tsrux, but since you got here, you most likely already use redux.

Actually, you don't need redux specifically, since tsrux has no dependency on redux. You could use any other library that uses the same API for actions and reducers!
